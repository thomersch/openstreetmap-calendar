<h1>OpenStreetMap Calendar Documentation</h1>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>The OpenStreetMap Calendar (OSMCAL) has been created because we want to reach more people with the events the community creates. Organizers should have it easier to publish their events and participants should be able to find nearby events. The calendar shall be powerful, yet usable on mobile devices.</p>
<p>You can help us by spreading the word: Link to the calendar, create events and participate in them.</p>

<h2 id="RSS">RSS</h2>
<p>There are RSS Feeds: One global for all upcoming events, and one for each country. The base URL is <code>events.rss</code>. If only events in a certain country shall be returned, filters can be appended, e.g. <code>events.rss?in=Germany</code>.</p>

<p>For further information, refer to the <a href="/subscribe/">subscription information page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="API">API</h2>

<p>The available API endpoints <a href="{% static 'api.html' %}">are documented along with examples</a>.</p>

<h3>Changelog</h3>

<ul>
	<li>v2 (2020-09-30): Dates are now ISO 8601 strings with time zone info. v1 is therefore deprecated from now on.</li>
	<li>v2.1 (2020-10-07): A short date representation has been added to the date object (<code>human_short</code>) for displaying in event lists.</li>
	<li>v2.2 (2020-12-02): Filtering event lists by ISO country code (<code>?in=</code>) is now allowed and the preferred way. Filtering by country name is deprecated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source Code and Issue Tracker</h2>

<p>The OpenStreetMap Calendar is open source software and the code is <a href="https://github.com/thomersch/openstreetmap-calendar">hosted on GitHub</a>. If you experience problems, you can raise an issue there.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Why is there no support for repeated/periodic events?</h3>

<p>Because we don't want to list events that potentially do not exist anymore because their initial creators forgot to remove them. Our alternative is the 'Repeat Event' functionality which you can reach from the event's detail page and allows you to copy an existing event.</p>
